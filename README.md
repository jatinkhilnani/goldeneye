# goldeneye
Goldeneye makes it easy to look up 4-letter alpha codes (aka "banding codes") for North American birds.

It is available as a website (http://alphacodes.net) and a Google Chrome extension (download for free [at the Google Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/goldeneye-alpha-code-dict/jgpgcliniicmfeinkdefigmmnjhfadmm/reviews)).

Code organization:
- `docs/` - website
- `extension/` - extension
- `src/` - source material and scripts for preparing alpha code info
